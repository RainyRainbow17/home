			<h1>Eeyore</h1>
			<p>Eeyore is a donkey and for some he is their favourite Pooh character amongst all the others. 
			He is a blue-gray donkey&#44; about 3-years in age and stands 18 inches tall & 27 inches in length. 
			He is originally like the other Pooh character; stuffed with sawdust. 
			His appearance is highlighted by a small light pink bow on his tail. 
			He is an intelligent animal but tends to keep to himself. 
			Eeyore is a extremely gloomy donkey and has a very bad habit of losing his tail! 
			Mostly&#44; he tends to depend on his friends to find his lost tail for him and thereafter 
			Christopher Robin fixes his tail using a drawing pin. 
			What he simply adores is that his friends remember him on his birthday and celebrates it with him. 
			He often says &#34;Thanks for noticin&#39; me&#34; and &#34;Oh&#44; well&#34;.
