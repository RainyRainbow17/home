			Winnie-the-Pooh and she is 30 inches tall. She is the mother of a young joey (baby kangaroo) named Roo&#44; who is nearly 
			10 inches tall. Kanga carries her family in her pocket and is the fastest amongst all animals in the forest. She 
			takes utmost care of Roo and shall often warn Roo of possible dangers involved in the activities that Roo undertakes. 
			She often says "Now now Roo&#44; you mustn't do that dear&#44;" to which Roo mostly replies "But moma!" Kanga & Roo live in the Northern section of the 100 Acre Wood. 
			Every Tuesday Kanga goes to Poohâ€™s house and tries to teach him how to jump. Roo is the youngest member of the 100 Acre Wood&#44;
