			<h1>Rabbit</h1>
			<p>Rabbit is one of the 2 real animals that are recognized by their actual animal names in A.A Milne’s children’s story books. 
			Since he is a real animal it is considered that he has brains and the same goes for Owl. 
			He actually makes this clear in a conversation with Owl where he say “You and I have brains. The others have fluff”. 
			He is pushy and takes his own decisions&#44; is able to spell better compared to all the other animals. 
			He is quite certain about the important things in his life. What he likes doing most is organizing a plan and to lead group events&#44; 
			even if nothing gets done. He is unhappy if anyone disturbs or interrupts him while he is engaged in any kind of activity&#44; 
			he doesn’t like being bounced either. He relishes gardening and his favourite food is the carrot and other vegetables&#44; 
			he makes it a point to avoid Pooh during lunch time.
