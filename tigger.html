			<h1>Tigger</h1>
			<p>He is a very Bouncy Animal and resembles a tiger. 
			He is always in an electrifying &#38; exuberant mood and loves to bounce&#44; bounce and bounce. 
			He is 23 inches tall and his most standout feature is his springy tail. 
			His character is easily recognizable by the black &#38; orange stripes&#44; a springy tail&#44; and a long chin&#44; 
			beady eyes which all mix well into his bouncy and fun loving personality. 
			He is a bouncy&#44; pouncy&#44; flouncy and a trouncy creature that is always looking to make the most out of what life has to offer. 
			The most wonderful thing about Tiggers is that &#34;I'm the only one&#33;&#34; Tigger likes to bounce a lot&#44; &#34;cause that is what Tiggers do best.&#34; 
			His favourite food is the extract of malt but is known to be an extremely fussy eater. He takes a lot of pleasure in being able to &#34;unbounce&#34; 
			some of the other animals in the 100 Acre Wood.
